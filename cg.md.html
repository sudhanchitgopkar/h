# Lecture 1
## Objects and Representations
- Represent objects using triangles
    - "*if we know how to do triangles, we know how to do cats*"
    - Each triangle is an object which can (mainly) be represented by three vertices
    - Vertices are represented by coordinates and other associated data
        - Need coordinates $(x, y, z)$
        - Could also want colors, normal vector, texture, etc. Called `attributeData`
        - Stored in the `vertexBuffer` in OpenGL
    - All pixels within the vertices are determined and those pixels are colored as desired

## The `draw` Call
- Once all data is passed in, `draw` call is made
    - Each vertex and corresponding attributes are fed into the vertex shader from the vertex buffer
    - The vertex shader then returns a `gl_Position` (and possibly other data, called varying variables)
        - Uniform variables may also be applied *uniformly* to all the points passed into the vertex shader
    - Finally, this is passed to the Assembler which then feeds into the Rasterizer
        - Passed in groups of three
        - OpenGL Rasterizer calculates the pixels within the triangle (3 vertices passed in)
            - Each pixel within the triangle gets varying variables proportional to the vertices they're closest to
            - Each of these variables is passed into the fragment shader, which uses the variable and unform variables (if applicable) to return a screen color
        - Finally, screen color is plotted onto frame buffer

## OpenGL Terminology
- `glfw` is a cross-platform windowing system
    - For real applications, use separate platform-dependent windowing library
    - Opens windows
    - Informs you when some event occurs (e.g. mouse move, button press, window resize)
        - Callback functions handle these events
        - Meed global vars to access state since we aren't in control of the call seq

- `glew` allows programs to be run on windows, not needed for Windows/MacOS
- `glsl` is a shading language
    - allows you to write programs to be executed per vertex and to be executed for each fragment/pixel
    - OpenGL is told to compile, link, and load these shaders

### OpenGL Resources
!!! Warning
    Often inconsistent and confusing

- Make calls to `glCreateShader`, `glGenBuffer`, `glGenTexture` to create OpenGL resources
    - Returns `GLUint` with buffer data
    - When done, free object with `glDelete`

### OpenGL and C++
- In C++, resources managed by wrapping each resource type in its own cpp class
    - the constructor calls `glGen*` oe `glCreate*`
    - destructor calls `glDelete*`
    - **We will use capital 'G' for these types**
    - Whenever object goes out of scorpe, destructor automatically gets called in cpp
    - Don't want to allow objects to be copied so that we know exactly when they get destroyed

- Cannot make GL calls without window, so can't have any global vars
    - Can only have gloabl poiners to objects, then construct objects in body of code

- We also need to put data into our buggers
    - For `glProgram` we can use handles directly as arguments (e.g. `glUseProgram()`)
    - For buffers/textures, 2-step process
        - Bind resource using its handle to an openGL target
        - then make openGL calls that depend on the target
        - Sometimes these openGL calls will use the target name (not handle name), other times the target is implicitly assumed

### The Main Loop
- Initializes required objects
- Infinite loop
    - calls `draw` then `glfw` waits for event
    - upon event, updates and then another `draw` call
- When we draw, update a different buffer
    - Once drawing is complete, swap to buffer with the drawing

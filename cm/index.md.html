## Capital Markets Overview
### Types of Assets
- Real assets (investments)
    - require an input of resources today and deliver output of resources later
    - Determine productive capacity of an economy
- Financial assets
    - Claims to the output produced by real assets
- *Capital markets are environments where financial assets are traded*

### Financial Asset Classification
- Fixed income securities: 
    - Promise to make fixed payments in the future
    - Bills (short-term, < 1 year), bonds (long-term, > 10 years)
- Equities (stocks): 
    - Claims to a share of the profit of a corporation
- Derivative securities: 
    - Make payments that depend on the prices of other financial assets
    - Futures, swaps, options

### Utility of Capital Markets
- Shift the timing of consumption so it doesn't have to coincide with timing of income
- Allocate risk (share amongst many or distribute to those who can bear it)
- Allocate resources to the most productive real investment

## Functional Perspectives
- Institutional details are abstracted away
- Concepts remain the same across capitalist countries

## Basic Concepts of Finance
- Arbitrage: What do we know about asset-prices by assuming there are no risk-free profit opportunities
- Optimality: What is the best combination of risky financial assets given their returns and an individual investor's preferences?
- Equilibrium: What is the nature of asset prices and allocations when all investors have optimized and markets clear?

## Asset Framework
- Two periods, *now* and *future*
- Finite number of states, $S$ of states may occurr in the future
    - some state $s \in \{1, \dots, S\}$
- Finite number of assets, $N$ available
    - some asset $n \in \{1, \dots, N\}$
    - Assets cost money *now* and pay off in the *future*
    - Each asset has a payoff profile
        - $n$ pays off $X_{ns}$ in state $x$
        - $n$ has payoff vector $[X_{n1}, \dots, X_{nS}]$
        - Current price of $n$ is $p_n$
    - $N$ assets are defined by an $N \times S$ matrix, $X$
        $$\begin{array}{ccc}\\
        X_{11} & \dots & X_{1S}\\
        \vdots & \dots & \vdots\\
        X_{N1} & \dots & X_{NS}
        \end{array}$$
    - The price of $N$ assets can be stacked into an $N \times 1$ vector 
        $$\begin{array}{c}\\
        p_1\\
        \vdots\\
        p_N
        \end{array}$$
- We can form a portfolio by buying $w_n$ units of asset $n$ for each $n \in \{1, \dots, N\}$
    - If we stack the number of shares into an $N \times 1$ vector, we get 
        $$w = \begin{array}{c}\\
        w_1\\
        \vdots\\
        w_N
        \end{array}$$
    - And then we can find the payoff of our portfolio over time using $w^TX$
        $$w^Tx = [\sum_{n = 1}^N w_nX_{n1} + \dots \sum_{n = 1}^N w_nX_{nS}]$$
    - Finally, the price of our portfolio is $w^Tp = \sum_{n = 1}^N w_np_n$

### Arrow-Debreu Securities
- Portfolio that pays $1 in state $s$ and $0 in $s'$
    - Called an Arrow-Debreu security
- Has state price (current price) $q_s$ for state $s$
- With $S$ AD securities, one for each state, the payoff matrix is the identity matrix:
    $$X^{AD} = \begin{array}{cccc}\\
    1 & 0 & \dots & 0\\
    0 & 1 & \dots & 0\\
    \vdots & \dots & \ddots & \vdots\\
    0 & 0 & \dots & 1
    \end{array}$$
    - This market is **complete** because we can obtain any payoff profile by combining securities
    - This completeness extends to real markets:
        - We can contrive some combination of assets where $w^TX = [1, 0, \dots, 0]$ *as long as $N = S$ and assets are non-redundant (no asset payoff is a linear combination of others)*

!!! Tip
    Thus, real markets are also complete!


## Arbitrage Theory
*Arbitrage opportunity*: investment strategy that:
- never requires a cash outflow now or in the future
- Generates a cash inflow in 1+ states in the future (but not now)

- Start by assuming no arbitrage opportunities
    - Has powerful implications for relative prices of assets

### Implications of No Arbitrage
- Law of One Price: 2 assets or portfolios with the same payoffs in every future state must have the same price
    - Otherwise buy cheap one and sell the expensive one!
- AD securities *must* have positive state prices
    - If ever negative, buy! cash inflow today and in 1 future state with no costs in any other state
    - If ever zero, buy it! Cash flow in 1+ future state with no costs at any other state

- Generates particularly strong results when markets are complete
- Tells us about relative pricing of asset, but not absolute
- To understand absolute pricing, we need:
    - Optimization: the demand for consumption in state, $s$
    - Equilibrium: adjustment of price, $q_s$ to ensure supply = demand

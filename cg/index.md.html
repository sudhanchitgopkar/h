# Lecture 1
## Objects and Representations
- Represent objects using triangles
    - "*if we know how to do triangles, we know how to do cats*"
    - Each triangle is an object which can (mainly) be represented by three vertices
    - Vertices are represented by coordinates and other associated data
        - Need coordinates $(x, y, z)$
        - Could also want colors, normal vector, texture, etc. Called `attributeData`
        - Stored in the `vertexBuffer` in OpenGL
    - All pixels within the vertices are determined and those pixels are colored as desired

## The `draw` Call
- Once all data is passed in, `draw` call is made
    - Each vertex and corresponding attributes are fed into the vertex shader from the vertex buffer
    - The vertex shader then returns a `gl_Position` (and possibly other data, called varying variables)
        - Uniform variables may also be applied *uniformly* to all the points passed into the vertex shader
    - Finally, this is passed to the Assembler which then feeds into the Rasterizer
        - Passed in groups of three
        - OpenGL Rasterizer calculates the pixels within the triangle (3 vertices passed in)
            - Each pixel within the triangle gets varying variables proportional to the vertices they're closest to
            - Each of these variables is passed into the fragment shader, which uses the variable and unform variables (if applicable) to return a screen color
        - Finally, screen color is plotted onto frame buffer

## OpenGL Terminology
- `glfw` is a cross-platform windowing system
    - For real applications, use separate platform-dependent windowing library
    - Opens windows
    - Informs you when some event occurs (e.g. mouse move, button press, window resize)
        - Callback functions handle these events
        - Meed global vars to access state since we aren't in control of the call seq

- `glew` allows programs to be run on windows, not needed for Windows/MacOS
- `glsl` is a shading language
    - allows you to write programs to be executed per vertex and to be executed for each fragment/pixel
    - OpenGL is told to compile, link, and load these shaders

### OpenGL Resources
!!! Warning
    Often inconsistent and confusing

- Make calls to `glCreateShader`, `glGenBuffer`, `glGenTexture` to create OpenGL resources
    - Returns `GLUint` with buffer data
    - When done, free object with `glDelete`

### OpenGL and C++
- In C++, resources managed by wrapping each resource type in its own cpp class
    - the constructor calls `glGen*` oe `glCreate*`
    - destructor calls `glDelete*`
    - **We will use capital 'G' for these types**
    - Whenever object goes out of scorpe, destructor automatically gets called in cpp
    - Don't want to allow objects to be copied so that we know exactly when they get destroyed

- Cannot make GL calls without window, so can't have any global vars
    - Can only have gloabl poiners to objects, then construct objects in body of code

- We also need to put data into our buggers
    - For `glProgram` we can use handles directly as arguments (e.g. `glUseProgram()`)
    - For buffers/textures, 2-step process
        - Bind resource using its handle to an openGL target
        - then make openGL calls that depend on the target
        - Sometimes these openGL calls will use the target name (not handle name), other times the target is implicitly assumed

### The Main Loop
- Initializes required objects
- Infinite loop
    - calls `draw` then `glfw` waits for event
    - upon event, updates and then another `draw` call
- When we draw, update a different buffer
    - Once drawing is complete, swap to buffer with the drawing

## Coordinate System
- Bottom left will always be $(-1, -1)$ and top right will always be $(1, 1)$
    - This is the "canonical cube"
    - This leads to potential distortions!
    - To fix, pass information to vertex shader (uniform variable)
        - Vertex shader can adjust `gl_position` appropriately
- For textures and pictures,
    - Lower left will always be $(0, 0)$ and top right will always be $(1,1)$
    - This is the "unit cube"
    - `lerp` between two images, $A$ and $B$, with some interpolation factor (`lerper`), $T$ as $$(1 - T)A + TB$$
- For windows/windowing,
    - Top left will always be $(0,0)$ and bottom right will be $(w, h)$
    - To convert this to semi-unit-cube system, do
    ```c linenumbers
    y = g_windowHeight - y - 1
    ```

## 3D Geometry
- We need to represent the geometry of points in space and perform transormations upon them
- Points are represented by a coordinate vector
    - Specififed with respect to an agreed-upon coordinate system
    - Point consists of $(x, y, z)$ coords as follows:
    $$\begin{array}{c}
    x\\
    y\\
    z
    \end{array}$$

### Data Types
- Point: represents a place
- Vector: represents motion/offset between 2 ordered points
- Coordinate vector (**c**)
- Coordinate system 
    - "Basis" for vectors

### Coordinate Systems: Basis
!!! ERROR ToDo
    Fix formatting on arrays

- A basis is a minimal set of vectors needed to get *any* vector using vectors in the basis (and vector multiplication and addition)
    - Minimal = linearly independent
- Dimension is the number of basis elements needed
    - For us, it will be 3
- Thus, we can use the basis to get all vectors uniquely using $$\vec{v} = \sum_i c_i\vec{b}_i = [\vec{b_1} \quad \vec{b_2} \quad \vec{b_3}] 
    \begin{array}{c}
        c_1\\
        c_2\\
        c_3
    \end{array}$$

### Linear Transformations
- A linear transform $l: V \rightarrow V$
- Satisfies 2 rules:
    1. $l(\vec{v} + \vec{u}) = l(\vec{v}) + l(\vec{u})$
    1. $l(\alpha\vec{v}) = \alpha l(\vec{v})$

# Lecture 4
### Linear Transformations (Derivations)
$\vec{v} \rightarrow l(\vec{v})$ where $\vec{v} = \sum_i c_i \vec{b_i}$. Thus, $\sum_i c_i \vec{b_i} \rightarrow l(\sum_i c_i \vec{b_i})$ This, we know, is:
$$\begin{align}
    l(\sum_i c_i \vec{b_i}) = \sum
\end{align}$$
